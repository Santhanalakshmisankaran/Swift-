//Extension 
it can extend the existing funtionality it cannot override the functionality of existing one.
it can only add the new functionality.
If u add the new functionality to an existing type after defining it also,  
the new functionality will be available in existing types.


// get and set method 
consider a mytriangle class. it has two properties one is sidelength and another one is perimeter. perimeter variable has two
methods call get and set.Its look like
import UIKit

class mytriangle
{
    var sidelength:Double=5;
  var perimeter: Double {
    get {
        return 3.0 * sidelength
        }
    set {
        sidelength = newValue / 3.0
        }
    }
}
let obj=mytriangle()
print("\(obj.perimeter),\(obj.sidelength)")
obj.perimeter=99
print("\(obj.perimeter),\(obj.sidelength)")

output:
perimeter:15.0,sidelength=5.0
perimeter:99.0,sidelength=33.0


//explanation
whenever you want access the perimeter property the get method works. It caculate the perimeter value through the sidelength.
whenever you are assigning some specific perimeter value that we also have to modify the sidelength of it . That time 
the set method sets the value of the sidelength. This is what the set and get method works.
//for retriving property the get method works 
//when assigning value to that property the set method works.
