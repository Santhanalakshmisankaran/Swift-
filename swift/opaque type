//opaque type is nothing but a associated type protocol as a return type.
explanation:
  we can use a normal protocol as a return type.we will not get any error by that.because we know the type of protocol.
  But we dont know the type of associated type protocols. we cannot use this as return type. to avoid this we are using opaque 
  type. opaque type is nothing but adding a some keyword in front of the protocol name.
