//protocol
protocols same like class or structure. Its a blueprint of methods and properties. protocols also can adopted by class
structure and enum.
Syntax:

protocol protocolname
{
  somedefinition
}

Syntax:(class adopted the protocol)

class classname:protocol1,protocol2
{
  definition of the protocol methods and properties
}

synatax:(If subclass inherits a super class then add a protocol next to the superclass name)


class subclassname:superclassname,protocol1,protocol2
{
  definition for protocols methods and properties
}

//get and set method

protocol also says that the property is stored or computed
computed property shows in protocol like

protocol protocolname
{
  var variablename:datatype{get set}
  var variablename:datatype{get}
 }


//Type property


type_property sholud have static keyword always before the var keyword in the protocol declaration

protocol anotherprotocol
{
  static var somepropertyname:datatype{get set}
}


//protocol example

import UIKit
protocol activities
{
    func walk()
    func sleep() -> String
    static func eat(variadicparam: String...)
}
struct person : activities
{
    func walk()
    {
        print("person is eating")
    }
    func sleep()->String
    {
        return("person is sleeping")
    }
    static func eat(variadicparam: String...)
    {
        print(variadicparam)
    }
}
class human : activities
{
    func walk()
    {
        print("person is eating")
    }
    func sleep()->String
    {
        return("person is sleeping")
    }
    class func eat(variadicparam: String...)
    {
        print(variadicparam)
    }
}
let person_obj=person()
person_obj.walk()
print(person_obj.sleep())
person.eat(variadicparam: "breakfast" , "lunch" , "dinner")
let human_obj=human()
human_obj.walk()
print(human_obj.sleep())
human.eat(variadicparam: "breakfast" , "lunch" , "dinner")

output:

person is eating
person is sleeping
["breakfast", "lunch", "dinner"]
person is eating
person is sleeping
["breakfast", "lunch", "dinner"]

explanation:
  In above example there is one protocol called activites,one structure called person and a class called human. The human and 
person conforms the protocol activities. 
the protocol has only the method declaration.the structure and class has a definition of a protocol methods. Observe the 
static methods they are not access through the instance they are access througth the class or structure name. Because they 
should have only one copy for the one class or structure.


//.....Associated type is protocol generic placeholder

protocol Container {
    associatedtype Item
    mutating func append(_ item: Item)
    var count: Int { get }
    subscript(i: Int) -> Item { get }
}
